5. Key Takeaways & Business Recommendations

✅ Focus marketing efforts on the “Below Average” and “Very Low” income groups, as they are the highest revenue contributors.
✅ Target Professionals, Skilled Manual, and Manual Labor workers, as they represent the largest spending segments.
✅ Monitor return rates, particularly for Horatio (1.25%), which has the highest return rate.
✅ Develop strategies to attract high-income consumers, as they contribute relatively little revenue despite their spending potential.
✅ Improve efforts to meet revenue & profit targets, as Maven Market is currently achieving only ~50% of its goal.
